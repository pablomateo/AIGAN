This project is part of **Udacity´s Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program**. Here you will find my personal solution to the challenge. The following project can be run using a Local Machine or using an external GPU (Solution provided by **Amazon Web Services** is recommended). Next, you can follow Udacitys instructions to install the necessary dependencies on a local machine or on AWS.

In this project, we train a **Geberative Adversarial Network** with it´s own generator and discriminator networks. We also set up the losses and optimizers which requires something new since we need to train the networks in parallel. I've included a notebook with exercises where you can check the implementation of the network and another notebook with solutions.

Follow the instructions to install the required environment and check the jupyter notebook files:

    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Intro_to_GANs_Exercises.ipynb

### Instructions - Udacity Project

## Project Requirements
To fully test the project, you might need to install some required packages. Please start by downloading **Anaconda** using the following link: [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once installed, clone this repository and access the downloaded folder through a **terminal** window. Next, you need to install the required packages:

    $ conda env create -f pmaienv.yml
    
Once all the packages have been installed, activate the environment:

    $ source activate pmaienv
    
Once finished, you can run my personal version of this project

     (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Intro_to_GANs_Exercises.ipynb
    
You can also check the solutions file

     (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook Intro_to_GANs_Solution.ipynb
